the-reserve.craft1 = The landing pod is capable of crafting items.\nPlace the smelted aluminum into the landing pod, and click on it.\nCraft some [accent]aluminum plates[] and [accent]aluminum rods[].
the-reserve.craft2 = Now, craft some [accent]aluminum cogwheels[].
the-reserve.factory1 = Now that you've crafted these items, you should now\nhave the [accent]burner drill[] and some distribution blocks unlocked.\nUsing these blocks, try building a factory to automatically mine and smelt aluminum.\n\n(Protip: The burner drill requires sulfur to mine ores, however a burner drill placed\non sulfur will mine indefinitely after being kickstarted with a little bit of sulfur.)
the-reserve.factory2 = [accent]Nickel[] is used in electrical structures.\nBuild a factory to automatically mine and smelt nickel.\n(Move upwards to find the nickel ore patch.)
the-reserve.geothermal-burner1 = Research the [accent]geothermal burner[].\nYou'll need to craft and unlock the items required to build it.\nOnce all the items have been unlocked, the geothermal burner should automatically be unlocked.\nEssentially, just try crafting any items you haven't unlocked yet.
the-reserve.geothermal-burner2 = Now, place a [accent]geothermal burner[] to start generating power.\nThe geothermal burner needs to be placed in hot areas, and requires sulfur to generate power.
the-reserve.archive-scanner1 = Research the [accent]archive scanner[].\n(Craft [accent]aluminum wires[])
the-reserve.archive-scanner2 = You will need to decode archives to unlock more advanced technology.\nMove upwards.
the-reserve.archive-scanner3 = Now, head to the right.
the-reserve.archive-scanner4 = Place an [accent]archive scanner[] facing this archive vault.\nThis will scan the vault and generate archive data once provided with power.
the-reserve.archive-decoder = Place an [accent]archive decoder[] next to the archive scanner.\nThis will receive the archive data and allow it to decode archives when provided with power.
the-reserve.automation = Supply the archive scanner and archive decoder with power.\nCraft and place some [accent]automation research cards[] into the archive decoder to begin decoding.\nYou can view the decoder's requirements by hovering over it.
the-reserve.outward-expansion = Now, repeat the same decoding process with the vault above.\n(It may be a good idea to automate certain items using the recently unlocked blocks first.)
the-reserve.end = To complete the sector, build a [accent]landing pod assembler[] facing a [accent]launch platform[], then assemble and launch a [accent]crude landing pod[].
